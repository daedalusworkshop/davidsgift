We give thanks to Hestia, goddess of the hearth, for keeping the space of hospitality and warm welcoming.

Thank you for feeding and maintaining the fire of Mount Olympus, and inspiring us to ignite a fire of our own (The Shamnic Coder's Guild).

"You remind me of Hestia, the Greek God of the hearth & home, your soul has a home in our hearts. Your soul is the match of the Shamantic Coder's Guild creating a fire standing over all." ~ Kasra

"You are a hero! You make difficult things feel easy and possible to accomplish and it's always a pleasure to get to know your mind and all the ways it sees of acting in the world." ~ Steven

"My friends in the Factorial System are wonderful people. It's been a privilege to meet them, watch them grow and share their gifts with the world. They are wise, skilled, generous, kind, and loving - truly a blessing to everyone who meets them. I look forward to see their presence in this world continue to blossom." ~ Tasshin

"Thanks for having been a great reading partner to me! I feel like since you've been gone, I've somehow regained my ability to focus on reading again, and I think it's in big part due to reading Fairyland with you! I'm grateful. (However, don't feel like you need to continue if you are feeling less social now or just don't want to. I just wanted to say thank you and welcome back - in whatever capacity you want to participate!) I hope your time away gave you what you were looking for! :)" ~Kit

"Dear David et al., may y'all be truly happy, may y'all be free from suffering, may y'all be free from ill will, may y'all be filled with lovingkindness. Thank you for your courage and the kindness you have shown to all living beings, your generosity in support of the highest good is well received and appreciated by all Buddhas. üôè "
